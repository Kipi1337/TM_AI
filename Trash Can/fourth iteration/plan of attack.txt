it goes as follows
how can we make the AI make a heatmap out of the map for practicing walls
and make it so it can be observed through some sort of picture/visual

make AI study the information to use in a practical race/application
and have it "eraseable" or moveable so we can start from scratch for another map

can we read memory or do I need to map out checkpoints for the AI

give it some sort of better reward for going fast and finishing
maybe pseudo checkpoint lines on the race for quidance and faster learning
