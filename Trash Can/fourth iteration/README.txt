!!
now the biggest problem is that every single restart of the game
I need to find out the memory addresses in order to use the AI
this should be resolved before further testing (DLL injecting??) OR
I just need to persist with the memory reading

I have officially spent 10 hours trying to get screen scraping to work.
it just doesn't because of the custom font the TMInterface uses.
Well time to learn how to DLL hook
