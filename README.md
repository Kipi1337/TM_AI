## Project on creating a self driving and learning AI for trackmania nations forever

This will be updated shortly with some sort of comprehensive map on what I want to do, if you want raw unedited thoughts so far,
There is a lot of readme files in the project folder and trash can.


## Installation
Use TMinterface, use the console command toggle_info and output_values.py to see if the hud reader is correctly set up for your spesific setup

## Usage
To use AI to teach to drive in Trackmania

## Support
Probably not needed.

## Roadmap
first get a consistent and easy way to read car position, velocity and turning values.
then flesh out memory and training faces more
I need a time to upload to youtube, one that is not 9... hours... long

## Contributing
Feel free to give me future improvement ideas if you have.

## License
You can copy my homework, just change it up a little ;)

## Project status
Project is finished on 31.1.2026 (future improvements will be made)
