purpose of this project is to make a way for AI to play trackmania,
so far there have been few not and successfull iterations.

the AI has a grasp on what to do and it requires fleshing out in order to perform.

Right now the biggest problem is memory reading,
who would have guessed that memory addresses change everytime you close a game
SO,
this order of business is to learn how to inject/hook the game engine to extract
the required values so testing becomes easier for my sanitys sake
OR
I just lose my mind tracking down memory addresses or just never close the game
while developing this project

This madness started on 8.1.2026 and I do not plan on quitting yet
