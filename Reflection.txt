what went well?
 - Everything I set out to do got done (find a way to extract data from the game and develope an AI to drive it)
 - Managed to do it in the time constraint which I set myself
 - Survived shortcomings (cheat engine memory reading not being permanent, bugs in the hud reading, not knowing half of the things I wanted)
 - Had fun and frustration while doing it
 - Ready for future improvement

What went not so well?
 - Planning phase was nonexistent which lead to many problems
 - Research was difficult without the basic grasp of things
 - Didn't get DLL hook to work
 - The further the project went I had to rely more and more on AI due to time constraints
 - The AI has yet to finish A01-Race
 - AI is still dumb (needs more training)
